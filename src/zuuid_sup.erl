%%% zUUID supervisor process.
%%%
%%% The supervisor process for the zUUID application. This module only defines
%%% a bare-minimum supervisor over the UUID state manager. The state manager is
%%% intended to only be run once per node, and only applies to generation of
%%% version 1 and 2 UUIDs (time-based generators).
%%%
%%% In special cases where multiple zUUID version 1 or 2 generators are desired
%%% on a single node, adjusting this module to behave as a simple_one_for_one
%%% or to have multiple permanent children registered differently would be
%%% a simple change and not interfere with the way the modules work (each
%%% state manager is configurable after startup with {@link zuuid:config/1}).
%%%
%%% @see zuuid:config/1.
%%% @see zuuid:start/0.

%% can be defined as tupled or maps, with maps being officially recommended but being
%% supported only by R18 and later. At the time of zuuid's release (February 2016) that
%% prevents zuuid from being used by most deployed Erlang environments. They have
%% therefore been defined as tuples below, but equivalent definitions as maps would be:
%% ```
%% RestartStrategy = #{strategy  => one_for_one,
%%                     intensity => 1,
%%                     period    => 60},
%% '''
%% ```
%% UUID_Man = #{id    => zuuid_man,
%%              start => {zuuid_man, start_link, []},
%%              type  => worker},
%% '''
%% The important part about these definitions is to recognize that zuuid_man is the
%% worker process that manages the state of the UUID v1 and v2 generators and performs
%% some (very basic) checks to ensure duplicate values are not accidentally generated
%% in the case calls to {@link zuuid:v1/0} or {@link zuuid:v2/0} occur faster than
%% 100 nanosecond intervals (or, really, that a series of return values are not closer
%% than that). This worker (and therefore its state) should be permanent for the life
%% of the node unless explicitly turned off (via {@link zuuid:stop/0}), and since it
%% acquired no external resources and maintains no persistent state on its own there
%% is no benefit in not brutally killing on termination if it exits abnormally or hangs
%% for some reason on shutdown.
